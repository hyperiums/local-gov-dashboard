# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Start Next.js dev server at http://localhost:3000
npm run build    # Production build
npm start        # Run production server

npm test         # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:run # Run tests once
npm run test:run src/tests/middleware.test.ts  # Run single test file
```

## Architecture

Civic transparency dashboard for Flowery Branch, Georgia. Aggregates local government data from public sources and generates AI summaries.

```
Frontend (Next.js App Router)

API Routes (/api/scrape, /api/summarize, /api/data)
    ↓
SQLite Database (data/flowery-branch.db) + Web Scraping (Playwright)
```

### Data Sources
- **CivicClerk Portal**: Meeting agendas, minutes, packets (scraped via Playwright)
- **Municode**: Published ordinances with full text
- **City Website**: Permit reports, financial documents (PDF parsing)

### Key Modules

**`src/lib/scraper/`** - Data extraction modules:
- `civicclerk.ts` - Playwright scraping of meetings with eventIDs
- `municode.ts` - Ordinance scraping and PDF extraction
- `permits.ts` - Monthly permit PDF parsing
- `resolutions.ts` - Extract resolutions from agenda items

**`src/lib/summarize.ts`** - AI summarization:
- Multi-level summaries (headline, brief, detailed, pdf-analysis)
- Cached in `summaries` table to avoid re-processing
- Uses GPT-4o for vision, GPT-4o-mini for text

**`src/lib/db.ts`** - SQLite with better-sqlite3:
- WAL mode for concurrency
- Auto-initializing schema
- Uses `getDb()` singleton pattern

### API Pattern

The `/api/scrape` endpoint orchestrates all data operations:

```typescript
POST /api/scrape
Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_SECRET
{
  "type": "bulk-meetings-with-agenda",
  "params": { "minYear": 2024, "limit": 10 }
}
```

Key operation types: `discover-meetings`, `bulk-meetings-with-agenda`, `ordinances`, `extract-resolutions`, `generate-meeting-summaries`, `link-ordinances`

### Database Tables
- **meetings** - City council meetings with agenda/minutes URLs
- **agenda_items** - Individual items with reference numbers, outcomes
- **ordinances** - From Municode or auto-created from agenda references
- **resolutions** - Extracted from agenda items
- **ordinance_meetings** - Junction table linking ordinances to meetings
- **summaries** - Cached AI summaries by entity_type/entity_id/summary_type

### ID Conventions
- Meetings: `civicclerk-{eventId}`
- Ordinances: `municode-ord-{number}` or `agenda-ord-{number}`
- Resolutions: `res-{number}`

### Authentication
Middleware protects `/admin`, `/api/scrape`, `/api/summarize`. Uses `ADMIN_SECRET` env var with cookie-based auth for pages, Bearer token for APIs.

## Environment Variables

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...           # Required for AI summarization
ADMIN_SECRET=<random-string>    # Required for protected routes
```

## Testing

This project uses Vitest for testing. Tests live in `src/tests/`.

**When to add tests:**
- Security-critical code (auth, validation, access control)
- Complex logic with edge cases
- Bug fixes (write a failing test first, then fix)
- Code that's difficult to test manually

**Testing philosophy:**
Strategic tests that prevent regressions are more valuable than high coverage numbers. A few well-placed tests on critical paths catch more bugs than exhaustive tests on trivial code.

## Deployment

Production runs via Docker on port 3001 with nginx reverse proxy on `root@45.55.236.77`. Deploy using the local script:
```bash
bash deploy.sh
```
This checkpoints the SQLite WAL, then pushes to the `production` git remote (a bare repo with a post-receive hook that checks out code, rebuilds Docker, and restarts the container).

Do NOT manually scp the database — the Docker container mounts `./data/` from the working tree that the post-receive hook checks out, so the git push is what delivers database changes.

Database persists in `./data/` volume mount. The database file is tracked in git.

## Data Refresh Workflow

Run the scrape pipeline locally against the dev server (`npm run dev`), then deploy. The `bulk-meetings-with-agenda` operation is the most comprehensive — it discovers meetings, scrapes agendas, links ordinances, extracts resolutions, and generates summaries in one call.

Typical refresh sequence:
```bash
# 1. Start dev server
npm run dev

# 2. Scrape recent meetings (does most of the work)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/scrape \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_SECRET" \
  -d '{"type":"bulk-meetings-with-agenda","params":{"minYear":2026,"limit":10}}'

# 3. Optional: scrape Municode ordinances (requires Playwright)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/scrape \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_SECRET" \
  -d '{"type":"ordinances"}'

# 4. Verify locally, then commit and deploy
sqlite3 data/flowery-branch.db "PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE);"
git add data/flowery-branch.db && git commit -m "data: ..."
bash deploy.sh
```

**Important:** SQLite WAL mode means changes live in `flowery-branch.db-wal` until checkpointed. Always run `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` before committing, or git won't see the changes. The deploy script does this automatically.

## Planning & Documentation

When planning new features or complex changes, use the `docs/` folder to store implementation plans and roadmaps. This folder is gitignored (except its README) to keep the repository clean while allowing local planning.

See `docs/README.md` for guidelines on what belongs there.
