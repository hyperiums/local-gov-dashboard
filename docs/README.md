# Local Planning Documents

This directory contains local planning documents, implementation roadmaps, and design notes.

## Purpose

These files are for **local development planning only** and are gitignored to keep the repository clean. They help track:

- Feature implementation plans
- Architecture decisions
- Development roadmaps
- Task breakdowns

## Why Gitignored?

For an open source project:
- Plans are often specific to a contributor's work-in-progress
- They can become stale quickly
- The code itself (plus issues/PRs) should be the source of truth
- Keeps the repo focused on production code

## What to Keep Here

- `citizen-features-roadmap.md` - High-level feature plans
- Implementation notes for complex features
- Local scratch files and research

## What NOT to Keep Here

- Sensitive information (API keys, passwords)
- Generated files that can be recreated
- Anything that should be in the main README or code comments

---

*This README is the only file in this directory that gets committed.*
